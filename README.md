# exchange
An app which user can exchange all kinds of stuffs except money.


This is a craglist like app, the major difference is that user can not buy/sell stuff, instead, he can only exchange something he wants with his own stuff.  The intention is based on the idea we should not measure something only by price, there are more value in there if we see it in a different way.  And something you don't need now doesn't mean it's useless or worthless, so you can exchange it to someone who really care it.  By exchanging, you also get something others care about, which can come along with a story.  And we can also make the world a better place by recycleing things.
